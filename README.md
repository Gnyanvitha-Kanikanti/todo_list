Design Choices:
User Interface (UI):
Clean and Simple Design: The UI is kept clean and straightforward to enhance usability. Minimalist design ensures that users can quickly understand and interact with the to-do list.
Responsive Design: Ensuring that the to-do list is responsive allows users to access and use it seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
Feature Choices:
Add, Edit, and Delete:
Add Task: A clear and prominent button allows users to add new tasks.
Edit Task: Users can modify task names or details by clicking on the task.
Delete Task: Include a delete button or icon to remove tasks.
Persistence:
Local Storage: Store tasks locally using browser storage to retain data even after a page refresh.
Challenges Encountered:
Cross-browser Compatibility:
Ensuring that the to-do list functions consistently across different browsers might pose a challenge. Testing and adjusting styles and scripts for compatibility are essential.
Data Synchronization:
Handling synchronization issues when multiple users access the to-do list simultaneously. This might require implementing backend functionality for data storage and retrieval.
User Experience (UX):
Striking the right balance between simplicity and functionality can be challenging. The design should be intuitive without overwhelming users.
Security Concerns:
Managing data securely, especially if sensitive information is involved. Implementing proper validation and security measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities.
Performance Optimization:
Optimizing the performance of the to-do list, especially as the number of tasks increases. Efficient algorithms and code optimizations are crucial.
